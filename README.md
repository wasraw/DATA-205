# DATA-205
Source for my capstone project for my Associates of Science in Data Science with Montgomery College partnered with my Internship at the Montgomery County Alcohol and Beverage Services (or ABS for short)

## Purpose

This repository is a space to showcase my progress with my capstone project partnered with ABS of Montgomery County. I will also have my most recently updated project published on my rpubs account which can be located [here](rpubs.com/wasraw)

## Project Updates

- [Update 1](AWarsaw_ABSBuyingPatternsCapstoneProject.qmd) : This update showcases my current progress with my capstone project including ingesting the data and all present EDA. If you would also like to observe the most recent updates rendered onto my RPubs account, you can locate that [here](https://rpubs.com/wasraw/1365662)
- [Update 2](AWarsaw_ABSBuyingPatternsCapstoneProject.qmd) : This update includes a list of additional sections along with the final product provided to ABS. To summarize, the sections included are:
  - Multinomial machine learning model testing using a table created specificaly for modeling to analyse how well the model observed my newly engineered variable **priority** based on the variables included in its' formula
  - Additional machine learning model testing using six different modeling methods to determine the best machine learning model that I should use to produce my final product by comparing each model's F1 score and accuracy based on a predetermined formula.
  - Inventory Management analysis where I determined the criterion for how each ABS store should fulfill their inventory based on provided storefront SKU counts. After determining the criterion for each location, I then used a random forest machine learning model (the model I chose to move forward with from the previous section) to help with producing a final csv file output which lists the products recommended to use for each store in the year 2025 (as the current dataset provided by ABS only has enough information for me to provide up to 2025 recommendations)
  - Final Remarks where I conclude my work and also list suggestions on how to improve the random forest model based on my findings and all constraints I ran into during the time I spent working on the project. 
- [Final Update](AWarsaw_ABSBuyingPatternsCapstoneProject.qmd) : This update includes document cleaning such as removing unused libraries and fixing typos in the quarto document.
  - [Powerpoint Presentation](AndreWarsaw_ABS_Presentation.pptx) : You can view my presentation slides here, including a generalized breakdown of my project
  - [Final Product](ABS_Inventory_Manager.qmd) : This quarto document includes the simplified version for product use for my client which includes the random forest model, instructions on what to run and comments on what to edit based on desired output. 
- [Powerpoint Update](AndreWarsaw_ABS_Presentation.pptx) : I have made minor updates to the powerpoint presentation which includes reducing the 'wordiness' of the slide alongside including more visuals which summizes the information presented and gives more context. I have also included a thank you slide, as I felt it was customary to include for the final presentation.
- [Final Report](AndreWarsaw_Final_Project_Report_Data205.pdf) : This report gives a brief summary of what I have done throughout the entire process of this project, more in detail than the powerpoint slides but not as much detail as the final quarto document itself.
